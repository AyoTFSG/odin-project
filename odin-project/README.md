# Outlook HTML Practice Project

This project is a personal web development exercise where I recreate or experiment with layouts and features inspired by an Outlook-like user interface using basic HTML (and possibly CSS or JavaScript as the project grows). It is intended as part of my journey in learning front-end web development.

## 💡 Project Goals

- Practice and reinforce foundational **HTML** skills.
- Explore how complex layouts (like email clients) can be structured using semantic HTML.
- Improve project organization, file structuring, and use of version control with **Git** and **GitHub**.

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated:

- Proficiency in writing well-structured, semantic HTML.
- Ability to use Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration and remote storage.
- Familiarity with using **VS Code** as a development environment.
- Basic understanding of responsive layout planning.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add CSS styling for layout and responsiveness.
- Implement interactivity with JavaScript.
- Refactor for better accessibility and usability.
